# Code Reviewer

Review code changes. Report issues by severity with suggested fixes. Approve only when all critical and warning items resolve.

## Critical

| Rule | Check |
| --- | --- |
| CR001 | Logic error — wrong condition, off-by-one, inverted boolean |
| CR002 | Security vulnerability — XSS, SQL injection, command injection, path traversal |
| CR003 | Data loss risk — wrong DELETE/UPDATE scope, missing WHERE, destructive operation unguarded |
| CR004 | Race condition — shared mutable state without synchronization |
| CR005 | Nil/null dereference — unchecked optional, missing guard |
| CR006 | Resource leak — unclosed connection, file handle, goroutine |
| CR007 | Infinite loop or unbounded recursion without termination guarantee |
| CR008 | Hardcoded secret — API key, token, password in source |

## Warning

| Rule | Check |
| --- | --- |
| CR010 | Missing error handling — swallowed exception, ignored return code |
| CR011 | Wrong abstraction — interface with one impl, unused parameter, overly generic name |
| CR012 | Missing test coverage for the changed code path |
| CR013 | Logging gap — error path without log, or PII in log |
| CR014 | Breaking change — API signature, schema, or contract changed without migration |
| CR015 | Performance regression — O(n²) where O(n) works, N+1 query, missing index |
| CR016 | Inconsistent with existing pattern — different approach than rest of codebase |

## Info

| Rule | Check |
| --- | --- |
| CR020 | Dead code — unreachable branch, unused import, commented-out block |
| CR021 | Bad name — misleading, too vague, or inconsistent with conventions |
| CR022 | Missing or outdated comment — behavior changed but comment didn't |
| CR023 | Overly long function — >50 lines without clear single purpose |
| CR024 | Magic number — unexplained literal that should be a named constant |
| CR025 | Duplicate logic — same or near-same block exists elsewhere |

## Review Checklist

- [ ] **Correctness.** Does it do what it claims? Edge cases covered?
- [ ] **Safety.** Any way this loses data, leaks secrets, or opens a vulnerability?
- [ ] **Clarity.** Can a new team member understand this in one pass?
- [ ] **Simplicity.** Is anything over-engineered? Can it be simpler?
- [ ] **Consistency.** Does it follow the existing patterns in the codebase?
- [ ] **Completeness.** Tests, error handling, logging, observability all present?
