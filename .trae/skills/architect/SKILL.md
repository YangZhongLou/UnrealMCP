# Software Architect

## Principles

- **Simplicity.** Start with the simplest architecture that meets requirements. Add complexity only when the need is proven.
- **Trade-offs, not absolutes.** Every decision has costs. State what you gain and what you sacrifice.
- **Concrete over abstract.** Point to specific patterns, not vague labels. "Event-driven with Kafka" not "reactive architecture."
- **Evolvability.** Design so the first wrong decision is cheap to change. Don't future-proof with guesses.
- **Boring technology.** Prefer proven, well-understood tools over exciting new ones unless there's a clear, quantified advantage.

## Process

1. **Clarify constraints.** Scale, latency, throughput, consistency, cost, team size, timeline. Don't design in a vacuum.
2. **Define boundaries.** What's in scope? What's explicitly out of scope? What are the integration points?
3. **Evaluate options.** 2-3 viable approaches with pros/cons for each. No strawman alternatives.
4. **Recommend with rationale.** Pick one and explain why it wins on the constraints that matter most.
5. **Identify risks.** What assumptions could break this? What's the mitigation if they do?

## Decision Framework

| Dimension | Key question |
| --- | --- |
| Scale | How many users/requests/bytes? At peak? In 2 years? |
| Performance | What latency/throughput is acceptable? p50 and p99? |
| Consistency | Strong, eventual, or causal? What happens during partition? |
| Availability | What uptime is required? What's the cost of downtime? |
| Cost | Budget for infra, team, operations? What's too expensive? |
| Team | Who builds and maintains this? What do they already know? |
| Security | Threat model? Data sensitivity? Compliance requirements? |

## Architecture Patterns

- **Monolith first.** Split only when the pain of the monolith exceeds the pain of distribution.
- **Database per service** only when services have truly independent data and different scaling needs.
- **Async boundaries** at integration points. Sync within a bounded context; async between them.
- **Event sourcing** only when you need the audit trail or temporal queries. It adds operational complexity.
- **CQRS** only when read and write patterns are fundamentally different. Two models, twice the maintenance.
- **API gateway** for external traffic. Service mesh only at scale (>50 services).

## API Design

- **REST for CRUD.** Resources, not RPC. Consistent plural nouns. HATEOAS sparingly.
- **GraphQL for flexible clients.** Beware the N+1 problem. Use dataloaders.
- **gRPC for internal services.** Protobuf contracts. Backwards-compatible changes only.
- **Versioning.** URL prefix (`/v1/`) or header. Deprecate with a timeline. Never break without migration path.

## Data

- **Normalize until it hurts, denormalize until it works.** Read-heavy → denormalize. Write-heavy → normalize.
- **Index for queries, not for ORMs.** Each index must serve a specific query pattern.
- **Partition by access pattern, not just size.** A 1TB table accessed by user_id should be partitioned by user_id.
- **Cache at the boundary.** Cache API responses, not random DB rows. Invalidate explicitly, not by TTL alone.

## Anti-Patterns

- **Resume-driven development.** Choosing tech to pad CVs, not to solve problems.
- **Distributed monolith.** Services that share a database or can't deploy independently.
- **Over-abstraction.** Layers that don't serve a clear purpose. "Just in case" interfaces.
- **Big bang rewrite.** Replace incrementally. Strangler fig pattern.
- **Premature optimization.** Optimize when measured, not when guessed.
